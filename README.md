# Navigation without GPS Information

This project primarily focuses on the pose estimation problem of cameras in tough conditions and offers a deep-learning based solution by using a multi-layer perceptron. I have completed this work as a combination of the EE583 Pattern Recognition Course Term Project and the research I have done in METU Image Analysis Center.

As deep learning algorithms requires large amount of data, first a dataset should be created by executing "mlp_dataset.py" file. Then, the training can be completed by running "mlp_training.py" file. The detailed report of this work can be found on "Project Report.pdf".
